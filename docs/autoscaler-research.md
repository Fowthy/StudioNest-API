# Kubernetes Deployment and Autoscaling Performance Testing using JMeter

This document describes the process and the results of performance testing for our Kubernetes-based application using the Kubernetes Autoscaler and Apache JMeter for stress testing.

## System Overview

Describe the system you're testing here. Include information about the application, the infrastructure, and how they're set up in Kubernetes. Mention any important factors that could impact performance.

## Performance Testing Approach

Detail the approach used to stress test your application. This includes:

- The configuration of JMeter (number of threads, ramp-up period, test duration, etc.)
- The type of tests that were performed (load testing, stress testing, spike testing, etc.)
- How the Autoscaler was involved during testing

## Autoscaling Configurations

Describe the different autoscaling configurations used in testing, including any changes made to configurations for each test. This includes:

- Min/Max number of Pods
- CPU Utilization targets

## Performance Metrics

List the metrics that were measured during testing, such as:

- CPU and memory usage
- Pod scaling times
- Request processing times

## Results & Analysis

Present the results of the tests here. This can be done in multiple ways:

- Use tables to provide an at-a-glance view of the most important results.
- Use graphs to visualize the changes in performance over time or across different configurations.
- Provide a narrative description of the results, particularly for complex results that require more detailed explanation.

Compare the performance results across different autoscaling configurations.

## Changes & Improvements

Discuss any changes made to the system or the autoscaler configuration based on the results, and how these changes improved performance.
