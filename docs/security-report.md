## Snyk

Snyk detected the following critical and high severity vulnerabilities:
![JMeter Configuration](/docs/img/snykresults.png)


### Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **Vulnerability:** `python:latest image`
    - **Description:** `Using python:latest in Dockerfiles`
    - **Severity:** Critical

2. **Vulnerability:** `Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information in curl/libcurl4`
    - **Description:** `This vulnerability refers to the unsafe transmission of sensitive information over an unencrypted network connection, also known as 'cleartext'. Such data can be easily intercepted by attackers. Specifically, the version 7.74.0-1.3+deb11u7 of curl/libcurl4.`
    - **Severity:** Critical
    - **Potential Impacts**: `This vulnerability could allow an attacker to intercept and read the sensitive information being sent in cleartext. This may lead to further security breaches like unauthorized access, data manipulation, identity theft, etc.`
    - **Possible solution**: `Ensure all trafic goes through https, not http`

### High Severity Vulnerabilities

1. **Vulnerability:** `Hardcoded Secret for AWS S3`
    - **Description:** `Usage of hardcoded secrets for aws email service`
    - **Path:** `server/src/main/{service}/app/{file}.py`
    - **Severity:** High

2. **Vulnerability:** `Hardcoded Secret for Google Firebase`
    - **Description:** `Usage of hardcoded secrets for Google Firebase`
    - **Path:** `server/src/main/auth`
    - **Severity:** High

3. **Vulnerability:** `Hardcoded Secret for Azure Storage Container`
    - **Description:** `Usage of hardcoded secrets for Azure Storage Container`
    - **Path:** `server/src/main/roomman`
    - **Severity:** High
### Medium Severity Vulnerabilities

1. **Vulnerability:** `Console Logs in client`
    - **Description:** `Usage of console.logs on production`
    - **Path:** `client/src/*`
    - **Severity:** Medium

## ZapProxy


ZapProxy detected the following critical and high severity vulnerabilities:
![Snykissues](/docs/img/zapproxyscan.png)

### Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **Vulnerability:** `Misconfigured Cloud Metadata in nginx controller`
    - **Description:** `A cloud metadata may be returned on the response from the gateway controller`
    - **Severity:** Critical

2. **Vulnerability:** `Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set`
    - **Description:** `Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page â€” covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.`
    - **Severity:** Medium

## SonarQube

SonarQube detected the following critical and high severity vulnerabilities:
![SonarCloud Security Test](/docs/img/sonarcloudfailing.png)

### High Severity Vulnerabilities

1. **Vulnerability:** `RabbitMQ hardcoded password`
    - **Description:** `password and credentials are stored directly in the files and pushed to public repo`
    - **File:** `server/src/main/chat/app/pika_client.py`
    - **Severity:** High

2. **Vulnerability:** `RabbitMQ hardcoded password`
    - **Description:** `password and credentials are stored directly in the files and pushed to public repo`
    - **File:** `server/src/main/payment/app/pika_client.py`
    - **Severity:** High

3. **Vulnerability:** `RabbitMQ hardcoded password`
    - **Description:** `password and credentials are stored directly in the files and pushed to public repo`
    - **File:** `server/src/main/shared/pika_client.py`
    - **Severity:** High

4. **Vulnerability:** `RabbitMQ hardcoded password`
    - **Description:** `password and credentials are stored directly in the files and pushed to public repo`
    - **File:** `server/src/main/shared/app/pika_client.py`
    - **Severity:** High
5. **Vulnerability:** `Google API key exposed`
    - **Description:** `Google API keys are used to authenticate applications that consume Google Cloud APIs. They are especially useful for accessing public data anonymously (like Google Maps), and are used to associate API requests with your project for quota and billing.`
    - **File:** `client/src/app/booking`
    - **Severity:** High
---
### Medium Severity Vulnerabilities
1. **Vulnerability:** `Copying recursively might inadvertently add sensitive data to the container. Make sure it is safe here.`

    - **Description:** `When building a Docker image from a Dockerfile, a context directory is used and sent to the Docker daemon before the actual build starts. This context directory usually contains the Dockerfile itself, along with all the files that will be necessary for the build to succeed. This generally includes:`
    - **File:** `All Dockerfiles`
    - **Severity:** Medium

![SonarCloud Medium Risks](/docs/img/mediumrisksonar.png)

In addition, I measured the duplications of code (3.1%), code smells (104) and the test coverage. However due to the time limit I won't fix the code related issues if they are not exposing sensitive data or are at medium/low severity.

## Fixes and Recommendations

Here are the recommended fixes for the vulnerabilities mentioned above:

### `Usage of python:latest image (Snyk)`

- **Description of the fix**: `Changed python:latest to python:3.12.0b1-slim`

- **Justification**: `the latest tag of the python image contains in total of 258 vulnerabilities, where for example the image python:3.12.0b1-slim contains only 54 and no critical ones. Replacing the image tag significantly reduces the chances of security leak from the image's vulnerabilities`
- **Status**: `Fixed`
- **Proof of Fix**:
![Snyk Images Tag Fix](/docs/img/snykfiximages.png)
I managed to reduce the critical issues to 0 and drastcitaly decrease the other vulnerabilities.


### `Hardcoded secrets for AWS S3`

- **Description of the fix**: `Moved hardcoded credentials and secrets for the AWS S3 server to .env files, hidden from git`

- **Justification**: `It is crucial to not publish any sensitive data online and it is a huge mistake to have hardcoded values directly in the files.`
- **Status**: `Fixed`

### `Hardcoded secrets for Azure Storage Contaniner`

- **Description of the fix**: `Moved hardcoded credentials and secrets for the Azure Storage Container to .env files, hidden from git`

- **Justification**: `It is crucial to not publish any sensitive data online and it is a huge mistake to have hardcoded values directly in the files.`
- **Status**: `Fixed`


### `Hardcoded secrets for Google Firebase`

- **Description of the fix**: `Moved hardcoded credentials and secrets for the Google Firebase to .env files, hidden from git`

- **Justification**: `It is crucial to not publish any sensitive data online and it is a huge mistake to have hardcoded values directly in the files.`
- **Status**: `Fixed`

### `Hardcoded secrets for RabbitMQ`

- **Description of the fix**: `Moved hardcoded credentials and secrets for the RabbitMQ cloud to .env files, hidden from git`

- **Justification**: `It is crucial to not publish any sensitive data online and it is a huge mistake to have hardcoded values directly in the files.`
- **Status**: `Fixed`
- **Proof of Fix**:
Running the code analysis, there were no critical issues found and only 6 medium vulnerabilities::

These are the vulnerabilities from the Snyk scan after updating the python image tags and removing all hardcoded secrets/credentials:

![SonarCloud Security Test](/docs/img/snykfix.png)
### `Console logs on production`

- **Description of the fix**: `Removed all console.logs from the frontend project on production`

- **Justification**: `There were a lot of console.logs, printing data from the requests with test words, which is really inappropriate for a production build.`
- **Status**: `Fixed`

### `Content Security Policy Header`

- **Description of the fix**: `The responses are configured to have the Content-Security-Policy header.`
- **Status**: `To Do`

I managed to fix all critical issues and reduced the high and mediul vulnerabilities to significantly lower amount, compared to the first scan.
<hr/>

After fixing some security issues and vulnerabilities from SonarCloud I got A (very secure) status for the reliability, maintainability, security and security review:

![SonarCloud Security Test](/docs/img/sonarcloudfixes.png)

The Quality Gate is still failing, as there is no test coverage detected. However, the main focus was fixing the security issues and leaks amd make sure that there as less vulnerabilities as possible on production.
