Non Functional Requirements:

### Security

All application code must pass SonarCloud code quality checks to ensure code is free from common vulnerabilities.

Use Snyk to continuously monitor the application and its dependencies for security vulnerabilities.

Incorporate ZapProxy to perform regular penetration testing and identify possible security risks.

### Scalability

The application should be designed to scale horizontally using Kubernetes for managing containerized services and workloads.

Deploy an auto-scaling configuration to handle unexpected spikes in load and ensure consistent performance.

The system must be able to scale up without significant downtime or degradation in response times.

### Availability

The application should be highly available and aim for an uptime of 99.99% (Four Nines).

Employ load balancers to evenly distribute network or application traffic across many resources, improving responsiveness and increasing availability.

Utilize redundancy strategies and failover solutions to minimize service interruptions.

### Performance

Use JMeter to perform stress and load testing to ensure the application can handle high traffic loads and responds quickly under these conditions.

Optimize application performance to ensure response times are below agreed thresholds under normal and peak load conditions.

### Monitoring

Incorporate Grafana for real-time monitoring of the application and the Kubernetes clusters to quickly identify and respond to problems.

Implement a logging strategy for application-level and system-level events that can assist in diagnosing problems.

### Reliability

The application must reliably handle and recover from erroneous situations.

Implement strategies to ensure data integrity and consistency, even during system failures.

### Maintainability

The codebase should be well-organized, well-documented, and adhere to industry-standard coding conventions.

Implement a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline for smooth deployments and updates.

### Disaster Recovery

Formulate and implement a disaster recovery plan that ensures the rapid restoration of services in the event of a critical failure.

Use specific tags for docker images.
